# 🏦 Prototype - Banking Services Optimization

### 🌟 Overview
This project is a **functional prototype developed in React** designed to modernize the digital experience for ICBC bank users. The proposal focuses on financial inclusion and process improvement for new user segments through a high-performance interface.

### 🛠️ Business Problem (Pain Points)
As a Computer Engineering student focused on innovation, I identified the following technical and business challenges:
* **UX Friction**: Complex interfaces that hinder technology adoption for younger or new segments.
* **Scalability Needs**: The system required a modular architecture to support future integrations and features.
* **Communication Gap**: The need to translate complex functional requirements into a tangible, high-impact technical solution.

### 💡 Solution & Applied Skills
To address these challenges, I implemented a solution that highlights both my technical and management competencies:
* **Frontend Development**: Leveraged **React + Vite** to ensure ultra-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a seamless user experience.
* **Component-Based Architecture**: Developed a clean, reusable code structure, facilitating long-term maintenance and scalability.
* **Project Management Mindset**: Successfully translated business goals into technical milestones, ensuring clear documentation of the development lifecycle.

### 🚀 Tech Stack & Tools
